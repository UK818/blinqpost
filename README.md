# blinqpost
iOS Assessment task

- Used programmatic UI to initialize ViewController from Scene Delegate
- initialized Firebase and mapped data to an array of posts using a post data model.
- Used protocol oriented programming.
- Adhered strictly to SOLID principles and made use of MVVM design achitecture to reduce coupling, achieve separation of concerns and write clean, reusable and maintanable code that is highly testable.
- made network call once on viewDidLoad and used KingFisher to load & cache data so as to avoid making multiple network calls.
- Used AVKit and AVFoundation to load and view videos.
- Used CollectionView over TableView so I could customize the cells better to achieve good UI/UX.
- kept the UI design simple and minimalistic for great user experience.
- Avoided Strong retain cycles so as to minimize risk of memory leaks.
- Implemented dark mode.

Dependencies Used:
- Firebase
- KingFisher
- RealmSwift
